## Chris Weed

I'm a full stack engineer but I absolutely love working the frontend code, user experience and overall feel of the application. I'm always building up new and random projects for myself that are typically half-baked or incomplete.  All public repos are just experiments and playings to learn something new or prove out an idea.  My "real" work is done in private repos and include

### LineUp Field Manager

The [LineUp Field Manager](https://app.lineup.soccer) was built to help me manage painting soccer fields for my local club. It started out as a project to see how far I could take a PWA including things like Push Notifications and get exposure to other frameworks such as Solid, NextJS and Ionic Framework. It's now currently an Ionic PWA that is used by the club to help predict when fields need to be re-painted and helps coordinate when a field is needed for games.

### Greedy Pirates

Built with my son during a MakeCode Arcade hackathon. This game is part of many of my projects that I do to simply learn and/or simply teach. I used the learnings from this to prepare for classes I taught for middle school aged students.  This also inspired some fun hacking with handheld devices. It's a pretty fun game go check it out: [Greedy Pirates](https://arcade.makecode.com/S66008-45860-30012-86138)

## 16 Colors

A fun side project that helped me learn and excersise some frontend-only limitations. I was inspired by some homework my kids where they had to do math problems to fill in a color-by-number piece of art. With my love of pixelart and wanting to do some "known" sprites, I came up with a way for people to upload a pixelart sprite and have it turn into a coloring sheet that you can print out. It has some limits but I wanted to see what some of the client-only file handling could do around parsing the image and then producing a printable grid. I even found a nice library that had a pretty solid color-to-name coversion! Check it out: [16 Colors](http://www.16colors.com/).
