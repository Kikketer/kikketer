I'm a full stack engineer but I absolutely love working the frontend code, user experience and overall feel of the application. I'm always building up new and random projects for myself that are typically half-baked or incomplete.  All public repos are just experiments and playings to learn something new or prove out an idea.  My "real" work is done in private repos and include

### LineUp Field Manager

The [LineUp Field Manager](https://lineup.soccer) was built to help me manage painting soccer fields for my local club. It started out as a project to see how far I could take a PWA including things like Push Notifications and get exposure to other frameworks such as Solid, NextJS and Ionic Framework. It's now currently an Ionic PWA that is used by the club to help predict when fields need to be re-painted and helps coordinate when a field is needed for games.
